# Mask_Detection_CNN

## Project -
The aim is to develope a model to predict Whether a person is wearing mask or not using Convolutional Neural Network.

## Convolutional Neural Network
CNN is a type of neural network model which allows us to extract higher representations for the image content. Unlike the classical image recognition where you define the image features yourself, CNN takes the image's raw pixel data, trains the model, then extracts the features automatically for better classification.


## Layers in Convolutional Neural Network
 
 * Input layer.
 * Convo layer (Convo + ReLU)
 * Pooling layer.
 * Fully connected(FC) layer.
 * Softmax/logistic layer.
 * Output layer. .
 
 ## Conclusion 
 #### We got an Accuracy of 87.20 %.
